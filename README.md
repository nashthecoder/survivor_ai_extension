# Survivor AI Extension

This repository contains a minimal Chrome extension scaffold using Manifest V3. It sets up a service worker, content script, popup, and a context menu entry.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select this directory.

## Usage

After loading, right-click on any page to see a "Survivor AI Action" entry in the context menu. The popup can be opened by clicking the extension icon.

This skeleton does not include any actual functionality yet; use it as a starting point for development.
